## Description

[Code Llama](https://github.com/facebookresearch/codellama) is a family of large language models for code based on Llama 2, trained on a size ranging from 7B to 34B, that has zero-shot instruction following ability for programming tasks. Code Llama was developed by fine-tuning Llama 2 using 500B tokens of publicly available code plus a small portion of natural language datasets related to code.

Meta AI provides multiple flavors of the Code Llama series, from foundation models (Code Llama) to Python specialists (Code Llama - Python) and even instruction-following models (Code Llama - Instruct). Code Llama and its variants are autoregressive language models using optimized transformer architectures. Code Llama 7B and 13B additionally support infilling text generation.

All Code Llama models are available under the LLaMA 2 Community License Agreement.
