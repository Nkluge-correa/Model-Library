## Description

[DALL-E 3](https://openai.com/dall-e-3) is the successor of DALL-E 2, which, according to OpenAI's release, can understand significantly more nuance and detail instructions than previous versions, diminishing the need for prompt engineering in its use.

Not much is known about the architecture, training protocol, or dataset involved in the development of this technology. However, one can speculate that the system is an improved version of the encoder-decoder type model used in DALL-E 2, but now based on the GPT-4 model and trained with an improved dataset.

Currently, DALL-3 powers Bing Chat assistant and is built natively on ChatGPT, following similar release protocols to earlier versions of the technology (i.e., restricted access via the OpenAI API).
