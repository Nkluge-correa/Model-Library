## Description

[ESM-2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm) is a SOTA general-purpose protein language model that can be used to predict structure, function, and other protein properties directly from individual sequences of amino acids. The ESM-2 series was trained on a range from 8M to 15B parameters, being the continuation of other models developed by Meta AI (ESMFold, ESM-1, etc.), created to tackle the [protein folding problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding).
  
ESM-2 was trained on an unsupervised masked language modeling task (i.e., predicting the identity of randomly selected amino acids in a protein sequence by observing their context in the rest of the series). One of the significant contributions this technology makes is in developing a prediction method that eliminates costly aspects of current state-of-the-art structure prediction methods by removing the need for multiple sequence alignment while greatly simplifying the neural architecture used for inference. This results in up to 60x speed improvement in inference, completely removing the related protein search process, which can take over 10 minutes with models such as [AlphaFold](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2) and [RosettaFold](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8754).
