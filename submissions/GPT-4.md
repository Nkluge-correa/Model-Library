## Description

[GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774) is a [generative pre-trained transformer](https://paperswithcode.com/method/gpt) model and successor of the GPT-3(3.5) series. Besides being capable of dealing with several NLP tasks,  GPT-4 is also a text-to-image model, making it different from its predecessors (i.e., multimodal). Also, unlike its predecessors, the GPT-4 technology already comes tuned by Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback ([RLHF](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf)), like ChatGPT.

The information provided in the documents [GPT-4 Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774) and [GPT-4 System Card](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4-system-card.pdf) that accompanied the model release is limited. In these documents, no information is found about the model's architecture, size, hardware, training protocol, datasets used, or any information that can be used to replicate the technology. According to its developers, this lack of disclosure is due to the competitive landscape and security implications related to LLMs.

Although less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance in several professional and academic benchmarks. As demonstrated by the ChatGPT technology, the post-training alignment process (RLHF) results in performance improvements on measures of factuality and adherence to the desired behavior.

## Organization

[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) is an American artificial intelligence research laboratory consisting of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc. and its for-profit subsidiary corporation OpenAI, L.P, founded in 2015 by Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, Jessica Livingston, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba. Their mission "_is to ensure that General Artificial Intelligence benefits all of humanity_."  
  
The organization maintains an active research and development agenda in AI Safety. In "_[Our approach to AI safety](https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-ai-safety)_", OpenAI states that it is committed to keeping Artificial Intelligence safe and broadly beneficial.
