## Description

[Galactica](https://github.com/paperswithcode/galai) is a large language model that can store, combine, and reason about scientific knowledge. Galactica was trained in five sizes (from 125M to 120B), using a large scientific corpus of papers, reference material, knowledge bases, and many other sources. It can perform scientific NLP tasks at a high level, like citation prediction, mathematical reasoning, molecular property prediction, protein annotation, summarization, and entity extraction.

Galactica is not instruction-tuned, which means it requires the use of prompts and special tokens (e.g., [START_REF], [END_REF]) to produce the intended behavior. These capabilities were developed via prompt pre-training, enabling the model to work out of the box for popular tasks.

Galactica is available as an open-source model and can be used through the [Galai](https://github.com/paperswithcode/galai) module (Python). Models are also available for download on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/facebook/galactica-1.3b).
