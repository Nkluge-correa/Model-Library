## Description

[OPT-175B](https://ai.meta.com/blog/democratizing-access-to-large-scale-language-models-with-opt-175b/) is a language model with 175 billion parameters, following a similar architectural design to that of GPT models, trained on publicly available data sets, to allow for more community engagement in understanding foundational models.

According to Meta AI, OPT-175B is comparable to GPT-3, while requiring only 1/7th of the carbon footprint to develop. Like other foundational models, OPT-175B can perform several NLP tasks out of the box in a zero/few-shot fashion.

OPT models were trained from a range between 125M to the 175B parameters model. All of them are openly released under the [OPT-175B License Agreement](https://github.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/blob/main/projects/OPT/MODEL_LICENSE.md).
