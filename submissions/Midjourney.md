## Description

[Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) is a generative artificial intelligence program and service created and hosted by San Francisco-based independent research lab Midjourney, Inc. Midjourney generates images from natural language descriptions (prompts), similar to OpenAI‚Äôs DALL-E and Stability AI‚Äôs Stable Diffusion

Midjourney is currently only accessible through a Discord bot on their official Discord server, by messaging the bot, or by inviting the bot to a third-party server. Users use the /imagine command and type in a prompt to generate images; in response, the bot returns a set of four images. Users may then choose which images they want to upscale.

Beyond the /imagine command, Midjourney offers other commands to send to the Discord bot, like the /blend command (allows the user to blend two images) and the /shorten command (gives the user suggestions on how to make a long prompt shorter).

## Organization

[Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) is an independent research lab involved in generative AI. Midjourney develops text-to-image models similar to OpenAI‚Äôs DALL-E and Stability AI‚Äôs Stable Diffusion.
