## Description

GPT-2 is a large language model developed by OpenAI, being able to generate human-like text from minimal prompts. The model is a decoder-only transformer pretrained on a large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion, meaning it learned from the raw texts without any human labels. It was trained on a dataset of over 8 million web pages and 7,000 fiction books from various genres. The resulting dataset (called [WebText](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/domains.txt)) weighs 40GB of text but has not been publicly released.

GPT-2 has had a significant impact on the field. The open-sourcing of the models (from [124M](https://huggingface.co/gpt2) to the [1.5B](https://huggingface.co/gpt2-xl) model) allowed for the creation of many fine-tuned versions and services based on this technology. The model was released in November 2019 and was followed by the 175-billion-parameter GPT-3 in 2020.
