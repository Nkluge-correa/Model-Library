## Description

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is a cloud-based artificial intelligence tool developed by GitHub and OpenAI to assist users of Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim, and JetBrains integrated development environments (IDEs) by autocompleting code.

GitHub Copilot is powered by the OpenAI Codex, a modified, production version of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3). When provided with a programming problem in natural language, Copilot generates a solution in code. It can also describe input code in English, autocomplete code sequences, and translate code between programming languages.

## Organization

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a platform for hosting source code and other files with version control using [Git](https://git-scm.com/). GitHub was created by Chris Wanstrath, J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner, and Scott Chacon in 2008. Currently (2023), the company is a subsidiary of Microsoft, which bought the platform for $7.5 billion in 2018.
