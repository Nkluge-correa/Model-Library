## Description

[GPT-J](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b) is a 6B parameter autoregressive language model with 28 layers, a model dimension of 4096, and a feedforward dimension of 16384. Like the GPT-Neo series, GPT-J uses [Rotary Position Embeddings](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/roformer). The model is also trained with a tokenization vocabulary of 50257, using the same set of BPEs as GPT-2/GPT-3.

GPT-J was trained on the Pile, being an addition to the EleutherAI collection of GPT models that can perform various language processing tasks without fine-tuning, such as language translation, code completion, chatting, blog posting, searching information, and much more.

GPT-J was trained on the [TPU Research Cloud](https://sites.research.google/trc/about/) and its weights are licensed under version 2.0 of the Apache License.

## Organization

[EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai/) is a non-profit artificial intelligence research group. The group was formed in a Discord server in July 2020 to organize a replication of GPT-3. In early 2023, it formally incorporated as the EleutherAI Foundation, a non-profit research institute.  
  
According to its [mission statement](https://www.eleuther.ai/about), EleutherAI seeks to (1) advance research on the interpretability and alignment of foundation models, (2) ensure that the ability to study foundation models is not restricted to a handful of companies, and (3) educate people about the capabilities, limitations, and risks associated with these technologies.
