## Description

[BlenderBot 3](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/08/blenderbot-ai-chatbot-improves-through-conversation/) is a 175B parameter dialogue model capable of open-domain conversation with access to the internet and long-term memory. The model was developed using [OPT-175B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01068) as its foundation, being the continuation of the [BlenderBot series](https://ai.meta.com/blog/state-of-the-art-open-source-chatbot/), and approximately 58 times the size of [BlenderBot 2](https://ai.meta.com/blog/blender-bot-2-an-open-source-chatbot-that-builds-long-term-memory-and-searches-the-internet/).

The result is a conversational model that [learns from interactions and feedback](https://parl.ai/projects/fits). BlenderBot 3 is designed to improve its capabilities through natural conversations and feedback from its users, being one of the first chatbots able to build long-term memory and continuously access and search the web.
  
BlenderBot 3 comes in three sizes: 3B, 30B, and 175B parameters. While the 3B and 30B models are available in the [ParlAI model zoo](https://parl.ai/docs/zoo.html), the 175B parameter version requires registration and acceptance of the terms and conditions of the BB3-175B License Agreement.
