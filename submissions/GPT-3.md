## Description

GPT-3 is a transformer-based autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters that achieves high performance, without any gradient updating or fine-tuning, on a wide range of NLP tasks (in a [zero-shot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-shot_learning) or few-shot fashion), including translation, Q&A, word unscrambling, execute 3-digit arithmetic, text classification, sentiment analysis, translation, and many others.

The capabilities of GPT-3 have also been used for various other applications, such as [code generation](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/) and [chat applications](https://chat.openai.com/) being the foundation that powers many modern AI applications. The model was released in May 2020 and was followed by the 4th iteration (GPT-4) in March 2023.

GPT-3 has been quoted by numerous [researchers and philosophers](https://dailynous.com/2020/07/30/philosophers-gpt-3/), such as David Chalmers, who describes it as "_one of the most interesting and important systems ever produced_".

## Organization

[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) is an American artificial intelligence research laboratory consisting of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc. and its for-profit subsidiary corporation OpenAI, L.P, founded in 2015 by Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, Jessica Livingston, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba. Their mission "_is to ensure that General Artificial Intelligence benefits all of humanity_."  
  
The organization maintains an active research and development agenda in AI Safety. In "_[Our approach to AI safety](https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-ai-safety)_", OpenAI states that it is committed to keeping Artificial Intelligence safe and broadly beneficial.
