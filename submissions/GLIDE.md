## Description

[GLIDE](https://gpt3demo.com/apps/openai-glide) (Guided Language to Image Diffusion for Generation and Editing) is a [diffusion model](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-07-11-diffusion-models/) that generates images through natural language. GLIDE also allows editions to be made to existing images using natural language prompts. These edits include inserting new objects, adding shadows and reflections, conducting images into the painting, and so on. 
  
According to OpenAI, human evaluators preferred the output images of GLIDE (3.5 billion parameters) to those of [DALL-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) (12 billion parameters), even though GLIDE is a considerably smaller model.  
  
OpenAI released a smaller model of GLIDE (GLIDE  filtered), trained with filtered data, whose code and weights are available on the project's [GitHub](https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im). Other models are not available to the public.

## Organization

[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) is an American artificial intelligence research laboratory consisting of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc. and its for-profit subsidiary corporation OpenAI, L.P, founded in 2015 by Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, Jessica Livingston, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba. Their mission "_is to ensure that General Artificial Intelligence benefits all of humanity_."  
  
The organization maintains an active research and development agenda in AI Safety. In "_[Our approach to AI safety](https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-ai-safety)_", OpenAI states that it is committed to keeping Artificial Intelligence safe and broadly beneficial.
