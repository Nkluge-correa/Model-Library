## Description

[PaLM 2](https://ai.google/discover/palm2) is a state-of-the-art language model that has better multilingual and reasoning capabilities and is more compute-efficient than its predecessor ([PaLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311)). The largest model in the PaLM 2 series, PaLM 2-L, is significantly smaller than the largest PaLM model but uses more training computing. The actual sizes (parameter count) of the PaLM 2 series are unknown.

According to Google AI, results show that PaLM 2 models significantly outperform PaLM on a variety of tasks, including natural language generation, translation, and reasoning. These results suggest that model scaling is not the only way to improve performance. Instead, performance can be unlocked by meticulous data selection and efficient architecture/objectives.

PaLM 2 is the foundation that powers other state-of-the-art models, like [Sec-PaLM](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/rsa-google-cloud-security-ai-workbench-generative-ai) and [Bard](https://bard.google.com/).

## Organization

[Google AI](https://ai.google/) is a research division at Google that focuses on developing artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Google is a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., a publicly traded company with multiple classes of shareholders. Google AI offers a range of machine learning products, solutions, and services that are powered by its research and technology.

According to Google AI, "_While we are optimistic about the potential of AI, we recognize that advanced technologies can raise important challenges that must be addressed, thoughtfully, and affirmatively.  These AI Principles describe our commitment to developing technology responsibly and work to establish specific application areas we will not pursue._" More on the principles that guide Google AI can be found on their [website](https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/).
