## Description

The Pathways Language Model, or [PaLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311), consists of a series of large language models, with sizes ranging from 8 billion, 62 billion, to 540 billion parameters. The development of PaLM was made possible through the utilization of Pathways, a machine learning system introduced in the [Pathways](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01253) paper  Pathways is designed to facilitate the highly efficient training of large neural networks, leveraging the power of thousands of accelerator chips.

PaLM's training data draws from diverse sources, including English and multilingual datasets that encompass high-quality web documents, books, Wikipedia, conversations, and GitHub code. Among PaLM's capabilities, one can cite language understanding, generation, reasoning, and code-related tasks.

Currently (2023), PaLM is not released to the public.
