## Description

[Imagen](https://imagen.research.google/) is a text-to-image diffusion model that builds on the language understanding capabilities of large transformer language models and the capacities of diffusion models to promote high-fidelity image generation.

Imagen uses a large frozen [T5-XXL](https://huggingface.co/google/t5-efficient-xxl) encoder to encode the input text into embeddings. Then, a conditional diffusion model maps the text embedding into a 64√ó64 image. Imagen further utilizes text-conditional super-resolution diffusion models to upsample the 64√ó64 image to 256√ó256, and later to 1024√ó1024.

Imagen is a text-to-image model that has not been released for public use due to concerns regarding responsible open-sourcing of code and demos.
