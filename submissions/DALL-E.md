## Description

[DALL-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) is a text-to-image model comprised of two main components. The first one is a discrete variational autoencoder (dVAE) that compresses 256√ó256 RGB images into a 32 √ó 32 grid of image tokens with a vocabulary of size 8192. The second component is an autoregressive transformer that takes concatenated sequences of text tokens and image tokens to model the joint distribution over this joint latent space. DALL-E uses the standard causal mask for the text tokens, and sparse attention for the image tokens with either a row, column, or convolutional attention pattern, depending on the layer.

DALL-E can create plausible images for a great variety of sentences that explore the compositional structure of language. Also, given this compositional nature, DALL-E is capable of putting together concepts to describe both real and imaginary things. And just like other large foundation models, like GPT-3, DALL-E can perform several kinds of image-to-image translation tasks when prompted in the right way, extending the capability of large-scale neural networks to perform tasks in a zero/few-shot manner.

DALL-E is not an open-source model. However, there are some open-source alternatives to DALL-E, such as [DALL-E Mini](https://huggingface.co/dalle-mini/dalle-mini), available on Hugging Face. In regards to the images generated by DALL-E, [according to OpenAI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6425277-can-i-sell-images-i-create-with-dall-e), "_you own the images you create with DALL-E_." Hence, one is allowed to reprint, sell, and merchandise them.

## Organization

[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) is an American artificial intelligence research laboratory consisting of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc. and its for-profit subsidiary corporation OpenAI, L.P, founded in 2015 by Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, Jessica Livingston, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba. Their mission "_is to ensure that General Artificial Intelligence benefits all of humanity_."  
  
The organization maintains an active research and development agenda in AI Safety. In "_[Our approach to AI safety](https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-ai-safety)_", OpenAI states that it is committed to keeping Artificial Intelligence safe and broadly beneficial.
