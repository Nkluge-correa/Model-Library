## Description

[Whisper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356) is a general-purpose speech recognition model based on the original [encoder-decoder transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) architecture trained on over 96 languages (other than English). Whisper can perform multilingual speech recognition, translation, and language identification, among other tasks. These multitask capabilities came via specification techniques (i.e., conditional training) used to enable a single input signal (and model) to generate different outputs (depending on the context of the task).

OpenAI trained several models of different sizes, from the smallest (39M parameters) to the largest (1550M), called [large-v2](https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions/661). These models were released on different dates, the first in September 2022 and the last model (the largest) in December 2022. In their publication, researchers report (except for English speech recognition) that the performance of Whisper technology on tasks such as multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification continues to increase with model size. At the same time, increases in dataset size result in improved performance on all tasks, although significant variability in improvement rates across tasks and sizes occurs.
  
Whisper is an open-source model intended to "_serve as a basis for building useful applications and for further research on speech processing_."

## Organization

[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) is an American artificial intelligence research laboratory consisting of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc. and its for-profit subsidiary corporation OpenAI, L.P, founded in 2015 by Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, Jessica Livingston, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba.
