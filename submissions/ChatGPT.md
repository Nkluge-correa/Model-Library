## Description

[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) is a large language model based on an improved version of GPT-3, developed in a similar way to [InstructGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155), which is trained to follow an instruction in a prompt.

ChatGPT was trained by OpenAI with reinforcement learning from human feedback ([RLHF](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf)). The basic idea behind RLHF is that a language model can be considered a policy over a vocabulary, which allows one to use RL techniques (e.g., optimizing over a reward model) for training purposes. In RLHF, this reward model is trained to be a surrogate for human evaluations. Hence, this synthetic version of human approval becomes the learning signal for the policy during training.

ChatGPT can provide answers to complex questions, [utilize plugins](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins), and query other OpenAI models (e.g., DALL-E 3), being the core engine being the [Chat completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) from OpenAI. Currently, the model is available for use via the OpenAI platform ([chat.openai](https://chat.openai.com/)) and API, where users can interreact with the model using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 as the base model.

## Organization

[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) is an American artificial intelligence research laboratory consisting of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc. and its for-profit subsidiary corporation OpenAI, L.P, founded in 2015 by Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, Jessica Livingston, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba. Their mission "_is to ensure that General Artificial Intelligence benefits all of humanity_."  
  
The organization maintains an active research and development agenda in AI Safety. In "_[Our approach to AI safety](https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-ai-safety)_", OpenAI states that it is committed to keeping Artificial Intelligence safe and broadly beneficial.
