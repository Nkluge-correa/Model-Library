## Description

[Llama 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288) is a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models ranging in scale from 7B to 70B parameters. This model is an updated version of [Llama 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971), trained on a new mix of publicly available data (increased the size of the pretraining corpus by 40%), with doubled the context length of the Llama 1, and
adopting the use of [grouped-query attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13245) (allowing faster inference). Meanwhile, the fine-tuned versions of Llama 2, called Llama 2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases.

The fine-tuned versions of Llama 2 were achieved via preference modeling techniques like [Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf). The RLHF approaches used by the authors were variants of [Proximal Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347) and [Rejection Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05862) fine-tuning.

Llama 2 models are available under the [LLaMA 2 Community License Agreement](https://ai.meta.com/llama/license/), making Llama models available for commercial and research use.
