## Description

[Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/) is a GPT model fine-tuned on code containing up to 12B parameters, capable of translating natural language sentences into programmatic code (e.g., Python). In an initial investigation of the GPT-3 model, it turned out that it could generate simple programs from docstrings. According to the OpenAI researchers, although rudimentary, this capability was exciting because GPT-3 was not explicitly trained for code generation, showing code generations could be a downstream application of this foundational model via fine-tuning.  
  
Codex can deal with languages like Python, JavaScript, Go, Perl, PHP, Ruby, Swift, TypeScript, and even Shell. Its data was compiled in May 2020 from 54 million GitHub repositories, totaling 159GB of text/code.
  
Codex served as the engine behind the initial versions of [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/). As of March 2023, the Codex models are deprecated and have been substituted by the newer [Chat models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api) from OpenAI.

## Organization

[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) is an American artificial intelligence research laboratory consisting of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc. and its for-profit subsidiary corporation OpenAI, L.P, founded in 2015 by Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, Jessica Livingston, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba. Their mission "_is to ensure that General Artificial Intelligence benefits all of humanity_."  
  
The organization maintains an active research and development agenda in AI Safety. In "_[Our approach to AI safety](https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-ai-safety)_", OpenAI states that it is committed to keeping Artificial Intelligence safe and broadly beneficial.
