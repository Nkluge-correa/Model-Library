## Description

[Cicero](https://github.com/facebookresearch/diplomacy_cicero) is an AI agent that can achieve human-level performance in [Diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game)), a strategy game involving both cooperation and competition that emphasizes natural language negotiation and tactical coordination between seven players.

Cicero integrates several models, from language models (R2C2-based transformer encoder-decoder with 2.7B parameters) to reinforcement learning policies and value networks (transformer encoder), combining strategic reasoning and natural language processing. According to the authors, across 40 games of an anonymous online Diplomacy league, Cicero achieved more than double the average score of the human players and ranked in the top 10% of participants who played more than one game.

The source code to create Cicero, as the weights of the models involved, are released under an [MIT](https://github.com/facebookresearch/diplomacy_cicero/blob/main/LICENSE.md) and  [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://github.com/facebookresearch/diplomacy_cicero/blob/main/LICENSE_FOR_MODEL_WEIGHTS.txt) licenses, respectively.
