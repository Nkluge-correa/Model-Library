## Description

[DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2) is a text-to-image model composed of two main parts: an encoder that generates a CLIP image embedding given a text caption and a decoder that generates an image conditioned on the image embedding. The result of this combination is DALL-E 2, a multimodal model that can generate photo-realistic images from simple natural language prompts. DALL-E 2 was trained on pairs of images and their corresponding captions drawn from a combination of publicly available sources and sources licensed by OpenAI.

In addition to generating images based on text description prompts, DALL-E 2 can modify existing images as prompted using a text description. It can also take an existing image as an input and be prompted to produce a creative variation on it.

Currently, DALL-E 2 can be accessed via API in a restricted and controlled way by OpenAI.

## Organization

[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) is an American artificial intelligence research laboratory consisting of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc. and its for-profit subsidiary corporation OpenAI, L.P, founded in 2015 by Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, Jessica Livingston, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba.
