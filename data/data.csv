ChatGPT was trained by OpenAI with reinforcement learning from human feedback ([RLHF](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf)). The basic idea behind RLHF is that a language model can be considered a policy over a vocabulary, which allows one to use RL techniques (e.g., optimizing over a reward model) for training purposes. In RLHF, this reward model is trained to be a surrogate for human evaluations. Hence, this synthetic version of human approval becomes the learning signal for the policy during training.

While GPT-3 was trained via causal language modeling, that is, to predict the next token in a sequence of tokens, InstructGPT was trained to model (minimize cross-entropy loss) the distribution of its fine-tuning dataset, comprised of human demonstrations of appropriate instruction-following behavior, and later to maximize the cumulative reward of a learning signal that serves as a proxy for human evaluations.

In general, this process can be divided into three steps: (1) Prompt/compilation pairs are collected (using human contractors to create them) and used to fine-tune the base model (GPT-3). (2) After fine-tuning, the model generates several outputs per sample (prompt). Crowdsourced human evaluators then score each output. This scoring is then used to train a reward model. (3) The reward model is then used to update the fine-tuned model again via [proximal policy optimization](https://openai.com/blog/openai-baselines-ppo/).

The final result of this process is InstructGPT, which comes in three different sizes (1.3B, 6B, and 175B parameters), fine-tuned from the Babbage, Curie, and Davinci versions of GPT-3 (currently deprecated). InstructGPT represents a significant advance towards alignment when compared to other LLMs, being capable of creating fewer imitative falsehoods, making up facts less frequently, and generating more acceptable outputs.

The largest model in the PaLM 2 series, PaLM 2-L, is significantly smaller than the largest PaLM model but uses more training computing.

These results suggest that model scaling is not the only way to improve performance. Instead, performance can be unlocked by meticulous data selection and efficient architecture/objectives.
