The Model Library is a project that maps the risks associated with modern machine learning systems. Here, we assess some of the most recent and capable AI systems ever created.

## How to submit a new model?

Follow these [instructions](submissions/0INSTRUCTIONS.md) if you would like to submit a model to our library.

After completing the [template file](submissions/0SUBMISSION-TEMPLATE.md) with your submission, add it to the submissions folder and make a PR request. All current models are stored on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nicholasKluge/model-library) for our demo and in [here](data/data.csv) for this repo. We use the [md-to-csv.py](md-to-csv.py) script to turn all submissions into a table and the [csv-to-md.py](csv-to-md.py) to reverse the process.
